# TODO List

(branch: refactor/cafe-model)

-[x] Edit script.js so that if the location clicked on from google autocomplete is not within london then an error message pops up and the later stuff is not loaded

-[x] Rewrite how the address is formatted in script.js (maybe take formatted address and cut off at 'London')

- Redo the slugging/slugging inverse so that we can query our db properly
  -Find a way to pass the cafe object from db into our html pages
